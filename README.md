# the-numpy.random-package

This repository covers the numpy.random package in Python. Jupyter notebook is used to explain the use of the package, including detailed explanations of at least five of the distributions provided for in the package.

## Overview

There are four distinct tasks that have been addressed in this Jupyter notebook:

1. Explain the overall purpose of the package.

2. Explain the use of the “Simple random data” and “Permutations” functions.

3. Explain the use and purpose of at least five “Distribution” functions.

4. Explain the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

## Install

### Installing Python and Jupyter Notebook

1. Python and jupyter lab are needed to run the `.ipynb` files in this repository.

2. Download `Python` from https://www.python.org/.

3. Type `pip install jupyterlab` and press enter.

4. Wait for jupyter to finish installing.

Please see the official [Installation of Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html) page if you are having issues.

## Running the Code

### Running the Code

1. Change directory to the folder that contains the.ipynb file you wish to run.

2. Type `jupyter lab`.

3. Jupyter lab will open in your browser as a new tab. Keep the command prompt window open as it needs to stay running while Jupyter Notebook is active.

4. Click on the `.ipynb` file you wish to run.

5. Click on `Kernel` and then select `Restart Kernal and Run All Cells`.

6. When finished, close the tab in your browser and then press press 'ctrl + C' in the command prompt to end the session.
